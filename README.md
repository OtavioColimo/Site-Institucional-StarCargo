HTML TAGS
- The < body > is where I put all the content and tags that the user will see
- The < header > was used to mark the header of the page
- The < img > was used to display images on the site
- The < pagina > was used to demarcate the different pages 
- The < p > was used to create all the paragraphs
- The < h1 > is used to provide a title for the page
- The < br > is used to create a line break (new line)
- The < link > is used to reference the Style Sheet
- The < div > is the most important tag here, as it allows us to define the width, padding, margin, and everything else for the content area

CSS TAGS
- The selector {Body} is used to apply changes to the page's body.
- The class {HEADER} is used to create the header for the page, add a background color, borders, logos and more.
- There are several properties for adjusting texts for each page, images and many others functions.
